We created the custom syscall mkdir3. Similar to mkdir and mkdir2 this syscall takes in arguments to create directories in the current directory the user is in.
mkdir3 specifically creates 3 directories and can be invoked using the following:
mkdir3 directory1 directory2 directory3

where directory1, directory2, and directory3 can be substituted for the directory names of your choice.

Sky completed shutdown2 and exit2. Added the calls to appropriate locations and the logic to retrieve the information provided after the command call.
